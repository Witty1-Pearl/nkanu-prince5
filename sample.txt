Task 1. Explore the CSS. Look at all the unique selectors. Find things that are new to you
and learn what to do. Find properties you may not be familiar with and google them. 

Provide your answers in a README.md file in your repo.

*Answers:
A.
1. Grouping of selector; e.g x,y.....
2. Universal Selector; e.g *
3. Type selectors; e.g. Elementname
4. Descendant selectors; e.g. xy
5. Child selectors; e.g. x>y
6. Adjacent sibling selectors; e.g. x+y
7. Attribute selectors; e.g. [att] | [att=val] | [att|=val] where att=attribute
8. Default attribute values in DTDs; In XML you will usually have to declare attributes in 

   an DTD file, with care such that a respective stylesheet must select attributes even if 

   the default values are not included in the document tree.
9. Class selectors; e.g. .classname
10. ID selectors; e.g. #idname
11. Pseudo-classes; e.g. :first-child | :link and :visited | :hover, and :focus | :lang.

1. Universal Selector: css universal selectors select any type of elements in an HTML      

 page. It matches a single element. An asterik such as "*", An asterik can also be       

followed by a selector. This is useful when you want to set a style for all the element    

within an html page, or for all the element within an html page.

	e.g. *{ CSS-Property: value;.................. }

2. Class selector; this select elements in an html page, if they have an attribute called  

   class, whose value matches the name of the class selector. In a style sheet document,   

   the name of the class selector is preceeded by a period such as ".",
	
	e.g. .classname{ CSS-Property: valu;........... } 

3. Type Selectors: this selects every instance of an element in an html page.

	e.g. elementName { CSS-Property: value; ................. }

4. id selector; CSS id selector selects any element in n html page, if it has an attribute 

   called id, whose value matches the name of the i selector. In a CSS document the name   

   of the id selector is preceded by a "#".

5. CSS pseudo classes; this select elements not based on their names, but based on state.
   For example, when you want to set the style for different states ( active, hover etc )  

  of the hyperlink, you can not do that by simply selecting the a element. You need to     

   use CSS pseudo classes in these cases. CSS pseudo-classes always start with a ":".

	elementsName:CSS_Pseudo_Class{ CSS-Prpperty: value; .............. }

6. CSS pseudo-elements; select elements not based on their names, but by the formatting of 

   those elements.For example, when you want to set the style for first-line or first-     

 letter of an element (say a paragraph), you can not do that by simply selecting the p     

 element. You need to use CSS pseudo-element in these cases. CSS pseudo-elements always    

   start with a ":".

	e.g. elementName:CSS_Pseudo_element{ CSS-Property: value; ................. }
